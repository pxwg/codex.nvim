# coact.nvim

`coact.nvim` is a Neovim workspace for human-agent pair writing. It keeps the conversation, context, patch review, and branch navigation inside the editor, so coding agents become collaborators that propose, revise, and negotiate changes instead of unattended code generators.

Provider threads are rendered as Neovim buffers, prompt tokens complete through `blink.cmp`, provider file changes become reviewable patch proposals, and pair-mode native `apply_patch` calls are reviewed and applied through Neovim before they touch the workspace.

Built-in provider adapters currently include Codex app-server:

```sh
codex app-server --listen stdio://
```

and Pi RPC:

```sh
pi --mode rpc
```

The provider layer keeps each backend protocol small and explicit while normalizing sessions, turns, messages, tool calls, and settings into the same Neovim UI model.

## Features

- Buffer-per-thread chat UI at `coact://thread/<id>`.
- `:Coact new`, `:Coact pick`, `:Coact resume`, `:Coact submit`, and `:Coact stop`.
- `:Coact status` and `require("coact").status()` for lightweight runtime state.
- Modern Neovim TUI render: provider items are normalized into blocks, then drawn with extmark headers, placeholders, virtual lines, stream gutters, composer token highlights, and a busy spinner.
- Streaming render for agent messages, reasoning, plans, command output, MCP calls, dynamic tool calls, collab-agent calls, web search, image events, and file changes.
- Expandable reasoning/tool/agent/patch placeholders with `za`; detail scratch views with `K` or `:Coact detail`.
- Prompt-anchor window following that keeps the composer stable while the active provider streams, but suspends auto-follow when you scroll away.
- App-server lifecycle notifications are preserved as timeline blocks; unknown notifications are retained as raw blocks and can be shown for debugging.
- Patch review window for `item/fileChange/requestApproval` and legacy `applyPatchApproval`.
- Pair-mode file-change review through provider-specific bridges, using the same file-buffer changed-block UI as the internal Neovim patch tool.
- Basic command and permission approval prompts.
- Optional dynamic tools exposed to supported providers under the `nvim` namespace:
  - `nvim.current_buffer`
  - `nvim.diagnostics`
  - `nvim.quickfix`
- Source-buffer tracking so prompt context and Neovim tools target the buffer that opened the thread.
- `blink.cmp` source where `$` comes from provider skills, `/` opens CLI-style slash commands, and `@` expands Neovim context.
- Thread picker via `snacks.picker` when available, with `vim.ui.select` fallback.

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.10 or newer.
- A working provider executable:
  - `codex` with `app-server` support for the default Codex provider.
  - Optional: `pi` with `--mode rpc` support for the Pi provider.
- `git` on `$PATH` is optional for legacy unified-diff compatibility in the internal `nvim.apply_patch` implementation.
- Optional: `snacks.nvim` for thread picking.
- Optional: `blink.cmp` for prompt completions.

## Installation

Use your plugin manager of choice. With `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
  "pxwg/coact.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("coact").setup()
  end,
}
```

## Setup

Default configuration:

```lua
require("coact").setup({
  provider = "codex", -- "codex" or "pi"

      offline = nil,
      tools = nil,
      exclude_tools = nil,
      extra_args = {},

      max_height = 0.33,
      statusline = {
        enabled = true,
        default_visible = true,

```

On macOS, `sanitize_malloc_env` removes inherited `MallocStackLogging*` variables before spawning app-server. This avoids noisy malloc runtime messages from parent GUI environments; set it to `false` if you intentionally need those variables while debugging Codex.

To use Pi as the active provider:

```lua
require("coact").setup({
  provider = "pi",
  providers = {
    pi = {
      command = { "pi", "--mode", "rpc" },
      -- Optional isolation. Omit these to use Pi's normal ~/.pi/agent state.
      config_dir = nil,
      session_dir = nil,
      edit_bridge = {
        enabled = true,
        timeout_sec = 600,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The Pi provider adapts Pi RPC sessions into coact.nvim threads, maps prompts to Pi `prompt` commands, maps `/model` and reasoning changes to Pi model/thinking commands, and normalizes Pi streaming, thinking, and tool events into the same renderer blocks used by the rest of coact.nvim. Submitting another prompt while Pi is generating queues it as a Pi `followUp` instead of failing with "Agent is already processing"; the queued prompt remains visible until Pi starts that turn. Pi extension UI status requests (`ctx.ui.setStatus`, `setWidget`, and `setTitle`) are mirrored into the history status card so Pi-side status customizations remain visible in Neovim without overloading the split separator or input box. In pair edit mode, `edit_bridge.enabled` dynamically injects a temporary Pi extension into only the Pi process started by coact.nvim. That extension overrides Pi's built-in `edit` and `write` tools, turns them into Neovim-reviewed file-change proposals, and then lets the existing in-buffer patch review write accepted hunks. It does not install or modify user Pi extensions or settings.

## Commands

```vim
:Coact new [initial prompt]
:Coact open [thread-id]
:Coact resume <thread-id>
:Coact pick
:Coact list
:Coact submit
:Coact stop
:Coact detail
:Coact health
:Coact status
:Coact statusline [toggle|show|hide]
:Coact restart
:Coact attach [all]
:Coact add-buffer
:Coact add-selection
```

Opening a provider thread starts in preview state with a read-only `coact-history` transcript buffer using the full UI height. Press an insert-intent key such as `i`, `a`, `I`, `A`, `o`, `O`, `gi`, `c`, `cc`, or `S` to open the unnamed `coact-input` composer below it. Type in the composer and press `<C-s>` or normal-mode `<CR>` to submit; normal-mode `q` closes the composer and returns to preview without discarding the draft. With the Pi provider, submitting while a turn is still generating queues the text as a follow-up. The composer grows with wrapped input up to `ui.composer.max_height`, then scrolls internally. The composer buffer is left unnamed rather than using a `coact://` URI so path-oriented completion sources keep a normal editing context. In history, use `za` on a placeholder block to expand or collapse reasoning/tool/agent details, `K` to open the full block detail buffer, `g?` for history key help, `gs` to toggle the status detail page, `gS` to show/hide the status card, `gt` for the Pi tree, `gc` for runtime status, `gy` to copy the latest output, `gd` for workspace diff, `gr` to refresh rendering, and `g]` / `g[` to jump to the next/previous message block. During streaming, transcript windows near the bottom keep following the conversation; scrolling away suspends that follow state for the window.

`:Coact status` reports whether the provider process is running, current and active thread ids, pending request counts, and the current thread generation/status. The same data is available programmatically through `require("coact").status()` for statuslines or custom integrations.

`:Coact statusline [toggle|show|hide]` controls the history status card. It is enabled by default via `ui.composer.statusline` and currently mirrors Pi RPC extension UI status, title, and widget updates when the Pi provider is active. Structured status is rendered as a compact card at the bottom of the history buffer after the chat transcript. Status fields wrap using the target window width and expose `CoactStatusLine*` highlight groups for colorscheme/user overrides.

`:Coact attach` reruns the configured buffer attach hook for the current thread buffer. `:Coact attach all` reruns it for every loaded transcript or composer buffer. Use `buffer.on_attach = function(bufnr, payload) ... end` or `require("coact").on("buffer_attached", cb)` to attach editor-local helpers such as input-method LSP clients, formula concealers, or buffer-local keymaps after coact.nvim creates a chat buffer.

`:Coact add-buffer` appends the current source buffer path to the active chat prompt using direct `@path` syntax. `:Coact add-selection` appends `@selection` when the source buffer has a visual selection.

Command-line completion covers subcommands, `attach all`, loaded chat buffer numbers, and loaded thread ids for `open`/`resume`.

## Health

Run `:checkhealth coact` to verify the Neovim version, active provider executable and protocol support, the Codex apply_patch runtime when the Codex provider is active in pair mode, optional picker/completion integrations, and dynamic tool registration. `:Coact health` still performs runtime provider initialization.

## Prompt Tokens

Prompt token completions are available in the `coact-input` composer through the `blink.cmp` source:

- `$skill:<name>` from the active provider's skill catalog where supported
- `/model`, `/status`, and other active-provider slash commands handled by coact.nvim
- `@buffer`, `@selection`, `@cursor`, `@diagnostics`, `@quickfix`, `@buffers`, `@cwd`, `@behavior`, `@file:`, `@image:`, and direct `@path/to/file`

Configure `blink.cmp` with:

```lua
require("blink.cmp").setup({
  sources = {
    default = { "lsp", "path", "snippets", "buffer", "coact" },
    providers = {
      coact = {
        name = "Coact",
        module = "coact.completion.blink",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

`@...` tokens are expanded by Neovim into extra provider inputs. Argument providers use `@provider:input`; paths with spaces can wrap the path in backticks:

```text
@file:`path with spaces.lua`
@image:`assets/screenshot.png`
@lua/coact/init.lua
```

The blink source completes paths after `@file:` and `@image:` using the same backtick form. Its documentation window previews the context that the selected `@...` completion will inject, including file contents, image attachment metadata, selections, diagnostics, and behavior diffs when available. In insert mode, pressing `<Tab>` immediately after `@file:` opens `snacks.picker.files` when available, with `vim.ui.select` only as a fallback; the selected file is inserted as direct `@path/to/file` syntax. `@image:` keeps the provider form because image inputs need image-specific attachment metadata. Custom hooks can be registered with `require("coact.context").register_hook(name, callback)`.

When a thread is opened from another window, `coact.nvim` remembers that source buffer as the thread target, so `@buffer`, `@selection`, `@cursor`, `@diagnostics`, and Neovim dynamic tools do not accidentally read a Coact UI buffer itself. `@selection` uses the source buffer's visual selection marks and includes file/range metadata plus diagnostics in the selected range. Selection context is attached only when the prompt explicitly contains `@selection` or you run `:Coact add-selection`, keeping context injection fully controlled by the prompt. Expanded text contexts are sent before the user request and are labeled as reference context, not instructions; the user request remains the final text input for semantic priority. `@buffer` includes buffer id, path, filetype, cursor, modified state, line count, and buffer text. `$skill:<name>` is converted to the provider's skill invocation format when the provider exposes skills. Slash commands are handled locally before `turn/start`, so `/...` entries are not sent as model-visible tool calls; accepting a slash completion removes the typed prefix and opens that command's page or picker instead of inserting text. Slash completions and `/help` are filtered by the active provider, so Codex app-server-only pages such as `/permissions`, `/sandbox`, `/goal`, or `/experimental` do not appear when the Pi provider is active. Each slash command declares a return form (`page`, `select`, `notify`, `insert`, or `action`) and uses one presenter for Neovim rendering. Settings commands such as `/model`, `/fast`, `/permissions`, `/sandbox`, `/reasoning`, `/personality`, and `/experimental` open Neovim pickers backed by provider catalog responses where available and update the active thread where the provider supports it. `/model` also offers the selected model's advertised thinking-effort choices when the provider returns them. Legacy `>buffer`, `>diagnostics`, and `>quickfix` still parse as Neovim context aliases, but new completions use `@`.

## Patch Review

Provider file edits are normalized into a single patch proposal model and opened in a review window. Codex app-server file-change approvals and Pi `edit`/`write` bridge proposals use the same review path.

Review keys:

- `a`: accept
- `A`: accept for session
- `d`: decline
- `c`: cancel
- `[c` / `]c`: jump between indexed file changes or diff hunks
- `<CR>` / `o`: open the related file at the hunk location when available
- `q`: close the review window without answering

The review buffer indexes file changes and unified-diff hunk headers with extmarks, so large patches can be inspected without manually scanning the whole markdown document. Outside pair mode, the active provider still owns the final file-change application after approval.

`edit.mode = "pair"` is the default. With the Codex provider, coact.nvim tells the app-server to use the native `apply_patch` tool and injects a stable `PreToolUse` hook into the process it starts. The plugin registers trust for that exact hook hash through Codex config, while per-session Neovim RPC details are passed through environment variables, so pair mode does not need `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`. That hook previews the patch in the affected Neovim file buffers before the native tool completes. Approving the review writes approved changed blocks through the same path as `nvim.apply_patch`, then returns `permissionDecision: "allow"` with a no-op `updatedInput.command` so Codex native `apply_patch` can complete without repeating the real edit; rejecting returns `permissionDecision: "deny"` with the user's reason. Follow-up app-server apply_patch permission and file-change approvals are automatically accepted only when their item id was already reviewed by the Neovim hook, so pair mode does not require `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

The pair-mode native review uses file-buffer changed-block controls with visible in-buffer hints: `.` approves the current changed block and prompts for an approval comment, `,` rejects it with a reason, `n` / `p` jumps between pending changed blocks, `ga` approves the rest with one approval-comment prompt, `gr` rejects the rest with a reason, `q` cancels, and `?` opens the key help. The review display wraps long before-lines into readable virtual lines and highlights changed characters inside the current replacement block when it fits the `edit.review.char_diff_*` budget. You can edit the previewed file buffer before approving; coact.nvim writes the final approved buffer state and returns the review summary to the provider as hook context, including approval comments, rejection reasons, and any diff between the provider proposal and the final Neovim-reviewed state. The previous `nvim.apply_patch` dynamic tool implementation remains in the codebase for compatibility and internal tests, but it is no longer exposed by default in pair mode.

For the Pi provider, pair mode uses a process-local extension override instead of Pi's global extension configuration. coact.nvim appends `--extension <tempfile>` while starting Pi RPC and passes the Neovim RPC socket, nonce, and timeout through environment variables. The override computes the proposed `edit`/`write` file content, opens the same in-buffer `patch_session` review used by `nvim.apply_patch`, and reports the accepted or rejected result back to Pi as the tool result.

`edit.mode = "yolo"` tells the active provider to use its native file-edit path directly without the Neovim review bridge. Calls to `nvim.apply_patch` are rejected while the tool is not exposed. The legacy option `dynamic_tools.prefer_nvim_apply_patch = false` still selects yolo mode unless `edit.mode` is set explicitly.

For the legacy/internal `nvim.apply_patch` buffer review:

- `.`: approve current changed block and prompt for a comment
- `,`: reject current changed block and prompt for a reason
- `ga`: approve all remaining changed blocks and prompt for one comment
- `gr`: reject all remaining changed blocks and prompt for a reason
- `gA`: use Neovim auto-apply for the session
- `q`: cancel the review
- `n` / `p`: jump between pending changed blocks
- `?`: show review keys

Approval comments, rejected changed-block reasons, partial-apply status, final file state, a final diff, and the target buffer's `nvim.diagnostics` output are returned to the provider as the dynamic tool result so the agent can continue from the user's feedback when that legacy tool is explicitly enabled.

## Events

`coact.nvim` emits `User` autocmds for editor integrations:

- `CoactBufferAttached`: after the buffer attach hook point runs for a thread buffer. `event.data` includes `bufnr`, `thread_id`, and `thread`.
- `CoactBufferOpened`: after a thread buffer is opened in a window. `event.data` includes `bufnr`, `winid`, `thread_id`, and `thread`.
- `CoactThreadOpened`: when app-server reports a thread start.
- `CoactGenerationCompleted`: when app-server reports a completed generation.

## Architecture

The plugin follows the same shape as a native Neovim chat client:

- `lua/coact/rpc.lua`: provider-driven stdio JSONL client.
- `lua/coact/providers/`: provider adapters for Codex app-server and Pi RPC.
- `lua/coact/state.lua`: thread, turn, item, pending-request, render-index, expansion, view, timeline/raw, and cache state.
- `lua/coact/core.lua`: provider notification and server-request reducer; maps normalized lifecycle events to UI generation states and timeline/raw blocks.
- `lua/coact/context.lua`: source-buffer tracking for prompt context and Neovim dynamic tools.
- `lua/coact/events.lua`: normalized provider item to modern Neovim TUI block conversion.
- `lua/coact/buffers.lua`: `coact://thread/<id>` `coact-history` transcript buffers, unnamed `coact-input` composer buffers, window option management, prompt collection, and block keymaps.
- `lua/coact/ui/render.lua`: extmark TUI renderer for headers, placeholders, virtual lines, spinner, stream gutters, composer tokens, view follow, and foldexpr ranges.
- `lua/coact/ui/tool_renderers.lua`: smart renderers for command, patch, and generic tool output.
- `lua/coact/ui/detail.lua`: scratch detail buffers for the block under cursor.
- `lua/coact/patch_review.lua`: app-server patch proposal review UI.
- `lua/coact/patch_session.lua`: in-buffer hunk review for `nvim.apply_patch`.
- `lua/coact/slash.lua`: CLI-style slash command catalog, declared return forms, local dispatch, result presenter, and settings pickers.
- `lua/coact/completion/blink.lua`: `blink.cmp` source.
- `lua/coact/dynamic_tools.lua`: Neovim-backed dynamic tools.
- `lua/coact/health.lua`: `:checkhealth coact` provider.

## Verification

Run the smoke test:

```sh
nvim --headless -u NONE -c 'set rtp+=.' -l scripts/smoke.lua
```

The smoke test loads the plugin, exercises health and status helpers, provider selection and Pi event normalization, parser/completion behavior, verifies source-buffer context tracking, checks `@file:` picker hooks and direct `@path` syntax, verifies patch-review hunk indexing, verifies Neovim-owned patch application and in-buffer changed-block rejection feedback, verifies provider initialization and empty thread creation, and asserts that the TUI renderer creates extmarks, placeholders, fold levels, detail output, view-follow state, timeline/raw event blocks, process output blocks, and a busy spinner.
