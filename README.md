# codex.nvim

`codex.nvim` is a Neovim client for Codex app-server. It keeps the Codex chat surface inside Neovim: each Codex thread has a buffer, thread navigation can use a picker, prompt tokens complete through `blink.cmp`, app-server file changes are reviewed as patch proposals, and `nvim.apply_patch` edits are reviewed hunk-by-hunk in the edited file buffer.

The plugin talks to Codex through:

```sh
codex app-server --listen stdio://
```

Codex app-server is experimental upstream, so this plugin keeps the transport layer small and explicit.

## Features

- Buffer-per-thread chat UI at `codex://thread/<id>`.
- `:Codex new`, `:Codex pick`, `:Codex resume`, `:Codex submit`, and `:Codex stop`.
- `:Codex status` and `require("codex").status()` for lightweight runtime state.
- Modern Neovim TUI render: Codex items are normalized into blocks, then drawn with extmark headers, placeholders, virtual lines, stream gutters, composer token highlights, and a busy spinner.
- Streaming render for agent messages, reasoning, plans, command output, MCP calls, dynamic tool calls, collab-agent calls, web search, image events, and file changes.
- Expandable reasoning/tool/agent/patch placeholders with `za`; detail scratch views with `K` or `:Codex detail`.
- Prompt-anchor window following that keeps the composer stable while Codex streams, but suspends auto-follow when you scroll away.
- App-server lifecycle notifications are preserved as timeline blocks; unknown notifications are retained as raw blocks and can be shown for debugging.
- Patch review window for `item/fileChange/requestApproval` and legacy `applyPatchApproval`.
- Interactive in-buffer hunk review for `nvim.apply_patch`, including reject feedback returned to the agent loop.
- Basic command and permission approval prompts.
- Optional dynamic tools exposed to Codex under the `nvim` namespace:
  - `nvim.current_buffer`
  - `nvim.diagnostics`
  - `nvim.quickfix`
  - `nvim.apply_patch`
- Source-buffer tracking so prompt context and Neovim tools target the buffer that opened the thread.
- `blink.cmp` source where `$` comes from Codex app-server skills, `/` opens CLI-style slash commands, and `@` expands Neovim context.
- Thread picker via `snacks.picker` when available, with `vim.ui.select` fallback.

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.10 or newer.
- A working `codex` executable with `app-server` support.
- `git` on `$PATH` is optional for legacy unified-diff compatibility in `nvim.apply_patch`.
- Optional: `snacks.nvim` for thread picking.
- Optional: `blink.cmp` for prompt completions.

## Installation

Use your plugin manager of choice. With `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
  "pxwg/codex.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("codex").setup()
  end,
}
```

## Setup

Default configuration:

```lua
require("codex").setup({
  app_server = {
    command = { "codex", "app-server", "--listen", "stdio://" },
    initialize_timeout_ms = 10000,
    sanitize_malloc_env = true,
  },
  thread = {
    model = nil,
    model_provider = nil,
    service_tier = nil,
    approval_policy = "on-request",
    approvals_reviewer = "user",
    sandbox = "workspace-write",
    permissions = nil,
    developer_instructions = nil,
    base_instructions = nil,
    personality = nil,
    ephemeral = false,
  },
  buffer = {
    on_attach = nil,
  },
  ui = {
    layout = "float",
    width = 0.82,
    height = 0.82,
    sidebar_width = 0.42,
    render_delay_ms = 35,
    auto_scroll = true,
  },
  render = {
    prompt_marker = "## Prompt",
    separator = "───",
    show_raw_events = false,
    virtual_blocks = {
      default_expanded = false,
      max_lines = 80,
      max_width = 180,
    },
  },
  completion = {
    enabled = true,
    ttl_ms = 30000,
  },
  edit = {
    mode = "pair", -- "pair" or "yolo"
  },
  dynamic_tools = {
    enabled = true,
    prefer_nvim_apply_patch = true,
  },
})
```

On macOS, `sanitize_malloc_env` removes inherited `MallocStackLogging*` variables before spawning app-server. This avoids noisy malloc runtime messages from parent GUI environments; set it to `false` if you intentionally need those variables while debugging Codex.

## Commands

```vim
:Codex new [initial prompt]
:Codex open [thread-id]
:Codex resume <thread-id>
:Codex pick
:Codex list
:Codex submit
:Codex stop
:Codex detail
:Codex health
:Codex status
:Codex restart
:Codex attach [all]
:Codex add-buffer
:Codex add-selection
```

Inside a Codex thread buffer, write below `## Prompt` and press `<C-s>` to submit. Use `za` on a placeholder block to expand or collapse reasoning/tool/agent details. Use `K` to open the full block detail buffer. During streaming, windows near the prompt keep following the composer; scrolling away suspends that follow state for the window.

`:Codex status` reports whether app-server is running, current and active thread ids, pending request counts, and the current thread generation/status. The same data is available programmatically through `require("codex").status()` for statuslines or custom integrations.

`:Codex attach` reruns the configured Codex buffer attach hook for the current thread buffer. `:Codex attach all` reruns it for every loaded Codex thread buffer. Use `buffer.on_attach = function(bufnr, payload) ... end` or `require("codex").on("buffer_attached", cb)` to attach editor-local helpers such as input-method LSP clients, formula concealers, or buffer-local keymaps after codex.nvim creates the chat buffer.

`:Codex add-buffer` appends the current source buffer path to the active chat prompt using Codex's official `@path` syntax. `:Codex add-selection` appends `@selection` when the source buffer has a visual selection.

Command-line completion covers subcommands, `attach all`, loaded Codex buffer numbers, and loaded thread ids for `open`/`resume`.

## Health

Run `:checkhealth codex` to verify the Neovim version, `codex` executable, app-server stdio support, app-server command shape, the Codex apply_patch runtime for `nvim.apply_patch` in pair mode, optional picker/completion integrations, and dynamic tool registration. `:Codex health` still performs the runtime app-server initialization check.

## Prompt Tokens

`codex.nvim` treats the chat buffer as the main UI surface. Prompt token completions are available through the `blink.cmp` source:

- `$skill:<name>` from Codex app-server `skills/list`
- `/model`, `/permissions`, `/mcp`, `/status`, and other CLI-style slash commands handled by codex.nvim
- `@buffer`, `@selection`, `@cursor`, `@diagnostics`, `@quickfix`, `@buffers`, `@cwd`, `@file:`, `@image:`, and direct `@path/to/file`

Configure `blink.cmp` with:

```lua
require("blink.cmp").setup({
  sources = {
    default = { "lsp", "path", "snippets", "buffer", "codex" },
    providers = {
      codex = {
        name = "Codex",
        module = "codex.completion.blink",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

`@...` tokens are expanded by Neovim into extra Codex inputs. Argument providers use `@provider:input`; paths with spaces can wrap the path in backticks:

```text
@file:`path with spaces.lua`
@image:`assets/screenshot.png`
@lua/codex/init.lua
```

The blink source completes paths after `@file:` and `@image:` using the same backtick form. In insert mode, pressing `<Tab>` immediately after `@file:` opens `snacks.picker.files` when available, with `vim.ui.select` only as a fallback; the selected file is inserted as direct `@path/to/file` syntax. `@image:` keeps the provider form because image inputs need image-specific attachment metadata. Custom hooks can be registered with `require("codex.context").register_hook(name, callback)`.

When a thread is opened from another window, `codex.nvim` remembers that source buffer as the thread target, so `@buffer`, `@selection`, `@cursor`, `@diagnostics`, and Neovim dynamic tools do not accidentally read the chat buffer itself. `@selection` uses the source buffer's visual selection marks and includes file/range metadata plus diagnostics in the selected range. If the source buffer has a visual selection, that selection context is automatically attached to each submitted prompt unless the prompt already contains `@selection`. Expanded text contexts are sent before the user request and are labeled as reference context, not instructions; the user request remains the final text input for semantic priority. `@buffer` includes buffer id, path, filetype, cursor, modified state, line count, and buffer text. `$skill:<name>` is converted to a Codex skill input using the skill metadata returned by app-server. Slash commands are handled locally before `turn/start`, so `/...` entries are not sent as model-visible tool calls; accepting a slash completion removes the typed prefix and opens that command's page or picker instead of inserting text. Each slash command declares a return form (`page`, `select`, `notify`, `insert`, or `action`) and uses one presenter for Neovim rendering. Settings commands such as `/model`, `/fast`, `/permissions`, `/sandbox`, `/reasoning`, `/personality`, and `/experimental` open Neovim pickers backed by Codex app-server catalog responses where available and update the active thread where app-server supports it. `/model` also offers the selected model's advertised thinking-effort choices when app-server returns them. Legacy `>buffer`, `>diagnostics`, and `>quickfix` still parse as Neovim context aliases, but new completions use `@`.

## Patch Review

Codex app-server sends file edits as file-change approval requests. `codex.nvim` normalizes these into a single patch proposal model and opens a review window.

Review keys:

- `a`: accept
- `A`: accept for session
- `d`: decline
- `c`: cancel
- `[c` / `]c`: jump between indexed file changes or diff hunks
- `<CR>` / `o`: open the related file at the hunk location when available
- `q`: close the review window without answering

The review buffer indexes file changes and unified-diff hunk headers with extmarks, so large patches can be inspected without manually scanning the whole markdown document. Outside pair mode, Codex still owns the final app-server file-change application after approval.

The `nvim.apply_patch` dynamic tool uses a different in-buffer flow. It accepts Codex's native `apply_patch` patch format, verifies it against a temporary copy of the edited files, converts the result to review hunks, opens the edited file directly, previews proposed changes as real buffer edits with old content shown as virtual lines, and writes only after the user resolves the hunks. Legacy unified diffs are still accepted when `git` is available.

`edit.mode = "pair"` is the default. In pair mode, codex.nvim exposes `nvim.apply_patch` as the Neovim-backed equivalent of Codex's native `apply_patch` tool and adds harness instructions that mirror the native patch grammar: put patch text directly in `arguments.patch`, start with `*** Begin Patch`, use relative `*** Add File`, `*** Update File`, `*** Delete File`, and optional `*** Move to` headers, and end with `*** End Patch`. The agent is told to prefer small, focused patches, read the current buffer or relevant current file content before patching, build the patch from exact current content, and re-read the buffer before retrying any failed patch. It must not call native `apply_patch` directly; pair mode declines native app-server file-change approvals. If Neovim auto-apply is enabled for a session, the agent still uses `nvim.apply_patch`, but codex.nvim skips interactive hunk review and applies through Neovim after verification.

The pair-mode instruction treats returned diagnostics, rejected hunk reasons, and stale-context retry guidance as pair-coding feedback for the next edit. Agents should fix reported errors and warnings before reporting completion, address hints when practical, incorporate rejection reasons into the next patch strategy, and explain any intentional or false-positive leftovers.

`edit.mode = "yolo"` disables the `nvim.apply_patch` dynamic tool and tells Codex to use the native `apply_patch` tool directly for workspace edits. Calls to `nvim.apply_patch` are rejected while yolo mode is active, so the review tool is only available in pair mode. The legacy option `dynamic_tools.prefer_nvim_apply_patch = false` selects yolo mode unless `edit.mode` is set explicitly.

In a `nvim.apply_patch` buffer review:

- `<leader>ca`: accept current hunk
- `<leader>cr`: reject current hunk and prompt for a reason
- `<leader>cA`: accept all remaining hunks
- `<leader>cR`: reject all remaining hunks and prompt for a reason
- `<leader>cf`: use Neovim auto-apply for the session
- `<leader>cq`: cancel the review
- `[c` / `]c`: jump between pending hunks

Rejected hunk reasons, partial-apply status, final file state, a final diff, and the target buffer's `nvim.diagnostics` output are returned to Codex as the dynamic tool result so the agent can continue from the user's feedback. In pair mode, codex.nvim preserves any user-provided developer instructions and appends the edit protocol as additional thread developer instructions.

## Events

`codex.nvim` emits `User` autocmds for editor integrations:

- `CodexBufferAttached`: after the Codex buffer attach hook point runs for a thread buffer. `event.data` includes `bufnr`, `thread_id`, and `thread`.
- `CodexBufferOpened`: after a thread buffer is opened in a window. `event.data` includes `bufnr`, `winid`, `thread_id`, and `thread`.
- `CodexThreadOpened`: when app-server reports a thread start.
- `CodexGenerationCompleted`: when app-server reports a completed generation.

## Architecture

The plugin follows the same shape as a native Neovim chat client:

- `lua/codex/rpc.lua`: stdio JSONL app-server client.
- `lua/codex/state.lua`: thread, turn, item, pending-request, render-index, expansion, view, timeline/raw, and cache state.
- `lua/codex/core.lua`: app-server notification and server-request reducer; maps Codex lifecycle events to UI generation states and timeline/raw blocks.
- `lua/codex/context.lua`: source-buffer tracking for prompt context and Neovim dynamic tools.
- `lua/codex/events.lua`: Codex `ThreadItem` to modern Neovim TUI block normalization.
- `lua/codex/buffers.lua`: `codex://thread/<id>` buffers, window option management, prompt collection, and block keymaps.
- `lua/codex/ui/render.lua`: extmark TUI renderer for headers, placeholders, virtual lines, spinner, stream gutters, composer tokens, prompt-anchor follow, and foldexpr ranges.
- `lua/codex/ui/tool_renderers.lua`: smart renderers for command, patch, and generic tool output.
- `lua/codex/ui/detail.lua`: scratch detail buffers for the block under cursor.
- `lua/codex/patch_review.lua`: app-server patch proposal review UI.
- `lua/codex/patch_session.lua`: in-buffer hunk review for `nvim.apply_patch`.
- `lua/codex/slash.lua`: CLI-style slash command catalog, declared return forms, local dispatch, result presenter, and settings pickers.
- `lua/codex/completion/blink.lua`: `blink.cmp` source.
- `lua/codex/dynamic_tools.lua`: Neovim-backed dynamic tools.
- `lua/codex/health.lua`: `:checkhealth codex` provider.

## Verification

Run the smoke test:

```sh
nvim --headless -u NONE -c 'set rtp+=.' -l scripts/smoke.lua
```

The smoke test loads the plugin, exercises health and status helpers, parser/completion behavior, verifies source-buffer context tracking, checks `@file:` picker hooks and direct `@path` syntax, verifies patch-review hunk indexing, verifies Neovim-owned patch application and in-buffer hunk rejection feedback, verifies app-server initialization and empty thread creation, and asserts that the TUI renderer creates extmarks, placeholders, fold levels, detail output, view-follow state, timeline/raw event blocks, process output blocks, and a busy spinner.
